## Getting Started

To get started with the framework:

1. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Validate Your Environment**:
   ```bash
   python validation/diagnose_environment.py
   ```

3. **Create a Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cp validation/quick_test_config.json configs/my_config.json
   # Edit my_config.json to suit your needs
   ```

4. **Validate Your Configuration**:
   ```bash
   python validation/validate_config.py configs/my_config.json
   ```

5. **Run Finetuning**:
   ```bash
   python example.py --config configs/my_config.json
   ```

## Best Practices

- **Start Small**: Begin with a small dataset and model to ensure everything works
- **Validate Configurations**: Always validate configurations before running
- **Check Environment**: Use diagnostic tools to identify issues
- **Use Efficient Techniques**: Prefer parameter-efficient methods like LoRA for faster training
- **Monitor Resources**: Watch memory usage and adjust batch sizes accordingly
- **Incremental Testing**: Test one component at a time when making changes

## Documentation Resources

- **README.md**: Main framework documentation
- **GETTING_STARTED.md**: Step-by-step guide for new users
- **validation/README.md**: Information about validation tools
- **validation/TROUBLESHOOTING.md**: Solutions to common problems
